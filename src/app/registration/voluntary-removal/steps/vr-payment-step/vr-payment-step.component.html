         If you pay your annual fee by Quarterly Direct Debit and you still have an outstanding balance to pay for the current renewal year you are required to pay the 
         total renewal annual fee before you can request voluntary removal from the register.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our records show that the following quarterly payments are still outstanding. On the next page you will be able to pay the total
         outstanding. If you dont think that this is correct please <a href="https://www.pharmacyregulation.org/about-us/contact-us" target="_blank">contact us</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          After you had paid the outstanding renewal fee please remember to cancel the direct debit mandate with your bank.
