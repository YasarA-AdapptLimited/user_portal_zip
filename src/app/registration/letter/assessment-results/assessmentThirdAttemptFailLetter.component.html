            To pass the assessment, you must pass part one and part two in the same sitting. For more information on how
            we award
            marks and set pass marks for the registration assessment please go to the

          <p>
            Candidates are permitted three attempts at the registration assessment. 
            As this is your third attempt, according to the assessment regulations, 
            you are not eligible to sit the assessment again.
          </p>

            You may wish to seek help from a specialist careers counsellor. They could advise you about career options
            which make
            use of your pharmacy degree, but do not need you to be registered as a pharmacist. A Citizens Advice Bureau
            should be
            able to give you the contact details of a careers counselling service in your area or you may also be able
            to find help
            from your university careers service. Unfortunately we are not able to help with this.
          </p>
