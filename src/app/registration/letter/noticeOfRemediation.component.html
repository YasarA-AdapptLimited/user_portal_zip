            <h2 class="notice">Notice of Remediation</h2>

            <div class="main-content">
                <p>
                 You were due to submit your revalidation records by {{submissionDeadline | date: 'd MMMM yyyy'}}. As you did not submit your revalidation
                records by this date, you are now in remediation. This means that you have six weeks from the date shown to submit your records
                or tell us why you cannot, before we take further action.
                </p>

                <b>What should I do next?</b>
         
                <p>
                     You should submit your revalidation records to us through myGPhC as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you have a good reason why you are not able to submit some or all of your revalidation records, you should tell us. You can
                request an extension to your submission deadline, or to complete fewer entries covering the same period.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To do this, log on to myGPhC and click on ‘Tell us why you can’t submit’ on the revalidation page. Fill in the form and
                submit it with supporting documents and we will consider your request.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you do submit records to us during the remediation period, your submission will automatically be selected for review.
                </p>

                <b>Why do you need my revalidation records?</b>

                <p>
                     We have a statutory duty to make sure pharmacy professionals practise safely and effectively. Our revalidation requirements
                    allow pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to show that they keep their knowledge and skills up to date in order to maintain
                    and improve their practice.
                </p>
             
                <b>
                     What if I don’t want to renew my registration?
                </b>

                <p>
                     If you’re not intending to renew your registration, tell us that you no longer want to be registered by completing an 
                     <a href="https://www.pharmacyregulation.org/registration/changes-your-registration/leaving-register" target="_blank">Application for voluntary removal form</a>. This helps us to keep the register information accurate and allows you to choose when you leave
                    the register. There is no charge to leave the register.
                </p>

                <b>What happens if I don’t submit my records without good reason?</b>

                <p>
                     If you do not submit your records by the end of the remediation period and do not provide a good reason why, we will take
                    further action and begin the process to remove you from the register. This is called ‘administrative removal’.
                </p>

                <p>
                 If you are removed from the register through this process and you later reapply to be registered, we will expect to receive
                and review your revalidation records as part of your application.
                </p>

                <p>
                     If you have any question about what you must do each year to meet the revalidation requirement,
