        <h2 class="notice">Foundation training welcome letter
        </h2>

        <div class="main-content">
          <!-- <p>Dear {{ registrant.title }} {{ registrant.surname }}</p> -->
          <p>I am pleased to confirm that you are now approved to begin foundation training. You are eligible to
            start training from the date given in your training record.</p>
          <p>Foundation training lasts for at least 52 weeks. Your training provider will work with you to help
            you achieve the performance standards you need to become a registered pharmacist. As long as you meet the
            standards, and your designated supervisor confirms this through your progress reports (see below), you will be eligible to
            sit the registration assessment towards the end of your training.</p>
          <p>If you pass the assessment and gain the necessary practical experience (as confirmed by your designated supervisor through
            the final declaration), you will be eligible to apply to be registered as a pharmacist.</p>
          <p>This letter contains important information that you will need as you progress through your training, so
            please read it carefully.
          </p>

          <b>Your foundation training number</b>
          <p>
            Your foundation training number is: <b>{{ preEntryNumber }}.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Please make a careful note of it, as you will need to quote it if you phone or email us, and when you apply
            to sit the registration assessment.
          </p>


          <b>Your training record</b>
          <p>Your training record contains the details that we currently hold for you. Please check them carefully and
            email us within seven days if you think there is a mistake or if your circumstances change. If your details
            are incorrect, or if they change, this may affect whether you can sit the registration assessment.</p>
          <p>It is your responsibility to make sure your training provider has an up to date copy of your training
            record.</p>
          <p><b>Important: </b>your online training record will not automatically update to reflect any changes you make
            to your training throughout the year. If there are changes to your training arrangements and you need an
            updated copy of your training record, please contact us.</p>

          <b>The foundation training manual</b>
          <p>The online foundation training manual sets out key information about your foundation training
            year. It is important that you read every section thoroughly and that you are familiar with all its
            contents. </p>

          <p>We update the manual from time to time during the training year, so the online version will have the most
            up-to-date information. You can download the entire manual as a PDF or just print the parts you feel you
            need.</p>
          <p>Your designated supervisor can also refer to the online foundation training manual, as well as specific guidance and
            resources for designated supervisors. Please also make sure you give your designated supervisor a copy of this letter.</p>

          <b>Progress reports</b>
          <p>Your progress reports are a vital record of your progress through the foundation training year. Your
            designated supervisor will need to complete and sign your reports each quarter (after 13, 26, and 39 weeks). They will need
            to confirm that your progress is at least ‘satisfactory’ at week 39 before you can sit the assessment.
            Please submit a copy of the week 39 progress report to us, as well as any signed as ‘unsatisfactory’. </p>
          <p>Please note that the assessment summary is a document purely for your own records. You do not need to
            submit a copy to us, unless we request it. </p>

          <b>Becoming a pharmacy professional</b>
          <p>It’s important to be proactive during your training, and make sure that you keep up to date with what is
            happening in your profession rather than just relying on information from us. This will help you to develop
            your knowledge and skills, and to prepare to start carrying out the revalidation activity you will need to
            complete if you become registered as a pharmacy professional.</p>
          <p>You can find out more about revalidation on our main website, including what you we need to carry out,
            record and submit each year of registration.</p>

          <b>Time limit to register</b>
          <p>To make sure that you have up-to-date knowledge and skills when you apply to register as a pharmacist,
            there is a time limit for completing your study and training to meet the registration criteria.</p>
          <p>You must successfully complete, within <b>eight years of the date you began your MPharm degree, or within
              four years of the date you began your OSPAP postgraduate diploma:</b></p>
          <ul class="bullet-point">
            <li>a UK accredited MPharm degree or OSPAP qualification</li>
            <li>
              52 weeks of foundation training in England, Scotland or Wales signed off as satisfactory by your
              designated supervisor
            </li>
            <li>the GPhC registration assessment with a pass result</li>
            <li>a registration application</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please see the criteria for registration as a pharmacist for more information.</p>
          <p><b>Important: </b>if, during your training year, you have a change of circumstances that may affect how
            long it takes you to complete your foundation training you should tell us.</p>

          <b>Staying in touch with us during your training</b>

          <p>During the year we will contact you to give you useful information about your training, and to tell you
            about the arrangements for sitting the registration assessment. We will contact you by email, so <b>make
              sure the email address you provided when you created your myGPhC account is correct</b>. You can update
            your email at any time through your myGPhC account.</p>
          <p>You will find <b>all the official GPhC forms that you may need to send to us</b> throughout the year in the
            foundation training manual on our website.</p>
          <p>If you need to contact us, you can use the <a href="https://www.pharmacyregulation.org/content/contact-us "
              target="_blank"><b>email form in the foundation training manual</b></a>, or call the Customer Contact Centre
            on <b>020 3731 8000</b>. </p>
          <p>If you need to send us any important documents by post, make sure you use recorded delivery or a service
            that allows you to track the correspondence and check that it has been delivered safely.</p>
          <p>You can also find out about any changes to foundation policy or processes by going to the GPhC
            website, or via Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn.</p>

          <b>Issues with your training</b>
          <p>
            During your training, you may meet situations that you do not expect. You should be able to resolve most of
            these with your designated supervisor, but sometimes you may need to contact us for advice.
          </p>
          <p>You can find answers to most questions either in the training manual or on our website- please check there
            first. If you do feel you need more information, you can contact us using the details above.</p>
          <p>I wish you the best of luck in your training, and I look forward to welcoming you onto our register next
            year.</p>

        <p>This training record confirms the training site details we had for you at the time your application was
          provisionally approved.</p>
        <p>
          If your training details changed after your application was provisionally approved these will not be reflected
          in this training record and an updated training record will be sent to you

        <p>
          You must check that the details below are correct. If there are any errors, please email us at

        <p>
