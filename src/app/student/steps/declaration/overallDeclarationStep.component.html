        I understand that
      </h3>
      <ol type="A" start="6">
        <li>
          I am applying to join the foundation training scheme, and the GPhC may use the information I have
          given in this form to assess my application. The GPhC may make any enquiries it considers relevant
          and appropriate to verify the details I have given on this application form.
        </li>
        <li>
          If I am found to have given false or misleading information in connection with my application for
          foundation training, the GPhC may reject my application and refer the matter to the relevant law
          enforcement agencies and any other third party it considers should be notified.
        </li>
        <li>
          I must tell the GPhC if there is any change that affects the fitness to practise declaration that I have
          made in section 3, within seven days starting from the day on which the event happened. I
          understand and accept that this information may also be used in future in relation to determining an
          application for entry to the register or assessing my fitness to practise, and that updated information
          may be requested at any such time for these purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The GPhC may discuss or disclose any personal or sensitive data that it holds about a trainee pharmacist (or trainee) with or to referees, educational establishments, professional
          regulatory and representative bodies, government departments, funding bodies, law enforcement or
          immigration agencies and any other third party, if the GPhC considers it to be necessary and
          proportionate in the public interest.

        </li>
        <li>
          If I am allowed to join the foundation training scheme, this does not mean the GPhC is making
          any assurances, undertakings or guarantees to me that I will be registered with the GPhC as a
          pharmacist.

        <li>
          The requirements for the foundation training scheme are given in section 2 of the GPhC foundation training manual, 
          and the procedures for the initial education and training of pharmacists
