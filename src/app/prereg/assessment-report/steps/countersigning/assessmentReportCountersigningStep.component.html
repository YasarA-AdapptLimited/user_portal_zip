            The pharmacist you choose to complete this report must be your designated supervisor, who is currently responsible for your
            training.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have an approved joint designated supervisor arrangement, you can select either designated supervisor to send the report to.
          </p>
          <p>
            The designated supervisor you nominate to complete this report will receive a notification through their myGPhC account that
            your report
            has been sent to them to sign. You will receive a notification once your designated supervisor has completed your report.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your designated supervisor will be asked to confirm your details are correct and to complete a report on your progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your progress report is marked satisfactory, you will be able to complete the application to sit the next
            registration assessment, if you choose to.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your progress report is marked as unsatisfactory, you will be able to request another progress report
            when your designated supervisor
            thinks this is appropriate, by emailing prereg@pharmacyregulation.org to request a progress report
            reset.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your designated supervisor will receive a notification to let them know your report has been submitted to them, but it is
            your
            responsibility to make sure they complete the report.
