        This fee covers the processing of your application for registration as a pharmacist, and is non-refundable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your application is successful, you will need to make a separate payment to cover your first year of registration. 
        You will receive a notification via myGPhC to ask you to do this, once your application has been assessed and approved.
      </p>
      <p>
         If your application is unsuccessful, you can reapply for up to six months from the date you submitted it without paying
        another fee. If you want to reapply after six months, you will need to start a new application and pay the application fee
        again.
