           Now your application has been approved, you must pay the fee of {{fee | currency: 'GBP': 'symbol' :'.2'}} to cover your first year of registration before you
          can join the register.

        <p>
            Important: do not practise as a pharmacy technician until you have received your GPhC registration number
            and your name appears on the online register.

            It is your responsibility to check this before you practice. Your registration payment receipt is not proof
            of your registration. Practising as a pharmacy technician while not on the register is breaking the law and
            you can be prosecuted.
