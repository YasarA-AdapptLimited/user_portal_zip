      There are sometimes reasons why you will not be able to submit some or all of your revalidation records when you renew your
      registration – because of serious illness, or maternity leave, for example. It’s important that you tell us as soon
      as you know that you will not be able to meet the submission requirement.

              Please give a brief explanation of the reasons why you are aren’t able to submit all of you records by your renewal due date.
              Make sure you explain how your situation has affected your ability to carry out and record CPD. If you have
              been or are likely to be absent from work, include this too. This will help us understand the reasons for the
              changes you request.

          <h2>Request changes to the requirements
          </h2>
          <div>
            <p>There are two main changes you can request the revalidation requirement:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>A submission extension You may want to request an extension deadline if you have carried out at least the required
                number of revalidation activities throughout your registration year, but need more time to write up and submit
                these records. While the extension is in place, you will still need to carry out and record new revalidation
                activities and submit these by your next renewal due date.</li>
              <li>
                Submitting fewer records If you have not been, or will not be, working as a pharmacy professional or carrying out revalidation
                activities for part of your registration year (because of a serious illness, or maternity leave, for example),
                you may want to request that you submit fewer revalidation records by your current renewal date. Use the
                form to tell us how many entries you will be able to submit. If there are any gaps in your records like this,
                they should not normally be longer than 12 months.
              </li>
            </ol>



            <p class="important">
              Important: If you don’t think you will be able to meet the revalidation requirement even with these changes, please contact
              us.

          </h2>
          <div>
            <p>The evidence you provide should help to confirm the reasons you give for not being able to meet the revalidation
              requirement. You
              <b>must</b> provide at least one document to support your request – we will
              <b>not</b> consider a request without any supporting evidence.
            </p>

            <p>The kinds of documents you send to us will depend on the reasons for your request. For example, some of the more
              common reasons for requesting changes to the requirements and the kinds of documents that you could use to
              support these are:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>maternity leave: a copy of your MAT1B form
              </li>
              <li>sickness leave: a doctor’s note or other medical documents which explain your condition
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can upload up to four documents. Each file must be smaller than 8MB.
