I also have the book with me when I have a locum shift in order to be able to use it as a reference if required.&nbsp;<br></div><div>I believe it is very important for a community pharmacist to be confident, be able to take the right decisions and management approaches for usual symptoms as this is when customers need us the most.&nbsp;<br></div><div>One day, that I was working as a locum, an elderly woman showed up complaining of indigestions and upset stomach. I managed to ask all the correct questions and concluded that the problem was due to the diclofenac medication that she was taking, so I had to refer her to go back to her doctor. It appeared that this was the correct course of action and I felt very happy and satisfied that I managed the situation correctly, even though I was not practicing as a community pharmacist for a while; the patient was satisfied as well as I was able to identify what was wrong.&nbsp;</div>"

Feeling less stressed makes me more proactive and potent at doing my job. <br></div><div>Before having started to read and learn further for the topic, I caught myself feeling a lot of pressure every-time that a patient would ask me questions like: So is that ok if I also take medication for depression? etc. On most occasions, I would call a pharmacist from another branch or check on the available data. I still always double check, however there is a big difference; now most of the time I check to be 100% sure while before I was lacking enough knowledge. This is something that the patient could feel when discussing with them and can definitely have a negative impact on my performance. After having completed my readings, the difference when counselling patients was dramatic as there is flow and confidence. I have received, several complements from customers on how helpful I was and how much I cared to check everything and provide them with detailed information while my manager pointed that out too. <br></div><div>Seeing my customers satisfied and happy is the most worthy reward for my effort and motivates me to keep learning.<br></div>"

Especially for acne, which I would say is by far the number one reason of concern for which mostly young patients are contacting us. I found myself improving significantly my knowledge and my capability of recognising different kinds of acne (i.e. Acne Vulgaris, Pustules, Nodules, Cystic Acne, etc) and treatment approach. <br></div><div>I ascertained my improvement as I started contacting less and less the Consultant Dermatologist of the Pharmacy for advice and guidance. This is something that my colleague noticed too and so confirmed my development in the area. I felt very satisfied and happy when performing a phone consultation with a patient with acne, I was able to answer all enquiries of the patient with confidence, provide extra information and advice. At the end of that call, patient thanked me with warmth and expressed her pleasure and how helpful our discussion was. This was very important to me as in the past, in most cases I would have had to say to the patient that I will need to ask the consultant dermatologist for further advice and get back to them, which although necessary on some occasions, usually can sound inconvenient for the patient and minimises the connection and effective communication between me and patients. Now, I can speak to them with certainty and enhanced knowledge and that is recognisable by them.<br></div><div>To conclude, I would say my skills and confidence in counselling patients with dermatological concerns has improved considerably, but of course there is still place for improvement.<br></div><div><br></div>"
