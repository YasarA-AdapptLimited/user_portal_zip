     Important: payment of this fee is not proof of registration. You are only considered registered once your name appears on
    the GPhCâ€™s register. You can confirm this by checking the public register on our website [hyperlink]. It is your responsibility
    to check this before you practise. You will receive a notification when you enter the register.
