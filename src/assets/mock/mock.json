The course was for community pharmacists and was co-facilitated by 2 GP's. One of the key skills the workshop aimed to develop is communication skills and better patient centered consultations. The GP's taught the pharmacists how to structure a consultation and how to take a full history.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Although I was there as a facilitator not a delegate I found the sessions really useful and learnt questioning techniques such as \"ICE\" and \"TED\" to help make consultations more patient centered.<br></div><div><br></div><div>I have been able to apply this knowledge to my own practice in several ways. As a community pharmacist I have been able to approach my consultations with patients in a different way and have found I was able to find out what the patient really wanted to ask much more effectively, which then made me able to tailor my advice accordingly. I have received some great feedback from patients who have often returned to let me know the outcomes from my advice.<br></div><div><br></div><div>I have also been able to apply this knowledge to my role as CPPE tutor and brought in various aspects of the things I learnt to the various workshops I have delivered. This has really helped to ensure the message about patient-centred care is embedded in the training I deliver.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Finally I have been able to apply this knowledge to my role as an Education supervisor for the general practice pharmacist training pathway. One of the key themes of the pathway is consultation and communication skills and I have been able to help coach the pharmacists to think about ways they can make their consultations more patient centred.<br></div>"

The notice will also give you a new deadline by which you must make your renewal declarations. If you do not complete your declarations in time the Direct Debit will not be collected and you will need to make your online renewal declarations and payment using a debit or credit card.</p><p>If you are setting up a quarterly Direct Debit there will be a yearly administration fee of £15 which will be taken with the first payment each year.</p><p>Step 2 (a): If you are paying by credit or debit card please have your card with you. You will be transferred to the online secure payment system after you have completed your declarations.</p><p>Step 2 (b): If you already have a yearly or quarterly Direct Debit set up to pay your renewal fee, all you will need to do is complete your renewal declarations.</p><p>Step 3: Sign in to myGPhC. See <a href=\"javascript:showItem(LoginQ1)\" title=\"link to 'How do I sign in' FAQ\">How do I sign in?</a></p><p>Step 4: Fill in and confirm the declarations. Once you have confirmed these you will be transferred to the online payment system if you are paying by credit or debit card. If you already have a Direct Debit set up then the process will be complete.</p><p>Step 5: Once your credit or debit card payment has been made you will be transferred back to myGPhC and the process is complete. If you entered an email address you will get a confirmation email for your payment. This is not a receipt.
